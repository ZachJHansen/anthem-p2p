Constructing final specification...
	Completed definition of renamed private predicate q_1/0 is being added as an input and assumption to the final specification.
	Completed definition of public predicate r/0 is being added as a spec to the final specification.

		Assumption includes r/0, which is not an input predicate (consider declaring r/0 an input predicate)
