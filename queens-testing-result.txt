Constructing final specification...
	Completed definition of renamed private predicate diff_1/3 is being added as an input and assumption to the final specification.
	Completed definition of public predicate q/1 is being added as a spec to the final specification.
	Completed definition of renamed private predicate q_1/2 is being added as an input and assumption to the final specification.
	Constraint forall X1, X2, X3 not (exists X4, X5 (X4 = X1 and X5 = X2 and q_1(X4, X5)) and exists X6, X7 (X6 = X1 and X7 = X3 and q_1(X6, X7)) and exists X8, X9 (X8 = X2 and X9 = X3 and X8 != X9)) is being added as a spec to the final specification.
